    "Software Engineer with a dream of changing the world through the use of computers.",
  summary: `I got into computer science because I wanted to learn how to make games. I didn’t write my first line of code until college, but that moment completely changed my life.
  I’ve spent most of my career as a Frontend developer, but along the way, I decided to branch out and become a Fullstack engineer to enable me in crafting more comprehensive and impactful solutions.
